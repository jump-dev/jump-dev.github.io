This page is a collation of materials for learning JuMP. The lists are by no
means complete or even comprehensive - they are based on submissions made to the
website. If you know of other materials for learning JuMP, please consider
[updating this page](https://github.com/jump-dev/jump-dev.github.io/edit/master/pages/learn.md).

## Tutorials

 * The [JuMP documentation](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/introduction/)
   contains a number of introductory "Getting started" tutorials. Start here if
   you haven't used JuMP before.
 * Joshua Pulsipher has a [short course on using InfiniteOpt.jl](https://github.com/infiniteopt/InfiniteOptTutorials/tree/main/short_course)
   that includes introductions to JuMP and Julia.
 * Xavier Gandibleux has [introductory materials on JuMP and Julia](https://julialang.univ-nantes.fr/julianantes/documents/),
   some parts of which are in French.
 * Abel Siqueira has a series of [YouTube tutorials in Portuguese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1hJsmMqpvw&list=PLOOY0eChA1uyjKRQDeR4-LfsObNqslIUh&index=8).
   The tutorials cover JuMP, as well as a range of other Julia packages and
   topics related to mathematical optimization.
