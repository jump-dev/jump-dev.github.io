title:  "The JuMP ecosystem"
---

The JuMP project consists of the main [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl)
package, and a large collection of supporting Julia packages.

The JuMP source code can be found at [https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl).

## MathOptInterface

Beneath JuMP, there is an abstraction layer called MathOptInterface 
([source code](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl)). 

MathOptInterface defines an API that solvers should implement so that they can 
be used by JuMP, handles the automatic reformulation of problems via _bridges_, 
and has a large infrastructure for automatically testing solvers.

## Solvers and solver-wrappers

At the bottom of the stack, there are solvers. These packages are either 
pure-Julia implementations of optimization algorithms, or they provide a Julia
interface to external solvers (often written in C or C++). Each solver also 
implements the API defined by MathOptInterface so that it can be used from JuMP.

A non-exhaustive list of solvers available through JuMP is available in the
[JuMP documentation](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/#Getting-Solvers-1).

## JuMP extensions

JuMP extensions are Julia packages which extend JuMP's algebraic modeling language
by providing additional syntax and functionality for specific problem classes.

Examples of JuMP extensions include:
 * [BilevelJuMP](https://github.com/joaquimg/BilevelJuMP.jl), which extends JuMP
   to support bi-level programs.
 * [Coluna.jl](https://github.com/atoptima/Coluna.jl), which extends JuMP to 
   support a branch-and-cut-and-price solution framework.
 * [InfiniteOpt](https://github.com/pulsipher/InfiniteOpt.jl), which extends 
   JuMP to support infinite-dimensional optimization problems.
 * [Plasmo.jl](https://github.com/zavalab/Plasmo.jl), which extends JuMP to
   support a graph-based algebraic modeling framework.
 * [SDDP.jl](https://github.com/odow/SDDP.jl), which extends JuMP to support 
   multistage stochastic programs.
 * [StochasticPrograms.jl](https://github.com/mbiel/StochasticPrograms.jl), which
   extends JuMP to support stochastic programs.
 * [SumOfSquares](https://github.com/jump-dev/SumOfSquares.jl), which extends
   JuMP to support polynomial optimization.
 * [vOptGeneric.jl](https://github.com/vOptSolver/vOptGeneric.jl), which extends 
   JuMP to support multiobjective programs.

Note that with the exception of SumOfSquares, these JuMP extensions are not part of 
the core JuMP-dev ecosystem, but are developed independently by the community.
 
(This list of JuMP extensions is open to new contributions! If you know one that 
isn't listed here, tell us by making a pull-request to edit the file [code.md](https://github.com/jump-dev/jump-dev.github.io/blob/master/pages/code.md).)

## Convex.jl

An alternative to JuMP is [Convex.jl](https://jump.dev/Convex.jl/stable/). 
Convex.jl is a Julia package for disciplined convex programming, built on-top-of
MathOptInterface. Thus, it can use all of the same MathOptInterface-compatible
solvers as JuMP.
