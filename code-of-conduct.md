---

The JuMP community strongly values inclusivity and diversity. Everyone should
treat others with the utmost respect. Everyone in the community must adhere to
the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) and the
[Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/), which
reflect the values of our community. Both these links have information on how to
confidentially report a violation.
