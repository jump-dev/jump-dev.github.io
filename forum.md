JuMP uses the "Optimization (Mathematical)" section of the
[Julia community Discourse]((https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt/13))
as our community forum.

Use the forum to ask usage questions related to JuMP, or to search for past
questions and answers. There is no such thing as a bad question, and this isn't
StackOverflow where you need to have a neatly framed question with a single
answer. If you look at past questions, you'll see that there are many
back-and-forth discussions!
