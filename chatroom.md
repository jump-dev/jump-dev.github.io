JuMP uses the `#jump-dev` channel of the Julia community slack to discuss
developer-related aspects of JuMP.

Use the chatroom to chat about package development related to JuMP. Perhaps you
want guidance developing a new solver interface to JuMP, or you have a specific
question about why some source code is the way it is. Prefer to ask more general
usage questions on our [community forum](/forum).

By using the chatroom, you agree to uphold the standards of our community as
