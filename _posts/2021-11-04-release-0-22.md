We're happy to announce the release of JuMP v0.22 and MathOptInterface v0.10,
which completes a major milestone on our path to JuMP v1.0.

Indeed, similar to how Julia v1.0 was Julia v0.7 with deprecations removed, we
anticipate---barring unexpected problems---that JuMP v1.0 will be JuMP v0.22
with deprecations removed.

The release notes for [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/dev/release_notes) and
[MathOptInterface](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/stable/release_notes/)
contain a detailed list of the changes.

For a full list of the merged pull requests and closed issues that contributed
to this release, see the tag notes for [JuMP v0.22.0](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/releases/tag/v0.22.0)
and [MathOptInterface v0.10.0](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/releases/tag/v0.10.4).

## Breaking changes

JuMP v0.22 is a breaking release. However, the breaking changes should be
invisible for the majority of users.

There are four main areas of breakage:

 * We have updated to MathOptInterface v0.10. If you used the MathOptInterface
   API, things may have changed. See the [MathOptInterface release notes](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/stable/release_notes/)
   for details.
 * Much of the JuMP-extension machinery has changed. This will only affect the
   authors of JuMP extensions. We have contacted most authors directly to advise
   them of the changes.
 * The inner workings of `backend(model)` has changed. This will
   only affect you if you accessed internal fields like `backend(model).model`.
   The two main changes are:
   * The backend is now a concrete type, instead of being a `CachingOptimizer`
     with an `AbstractOptimizer` field.
   * The cache is now  initialized in `EMPTY_OPTIMIZER` mode instead of
     `ATTACHED_OPTIMIZER`.
 * The `@SDconstraint` macro has been deprecated, but all usages can be replaced
   by the new set inequality syntax. (More on this below.)

## New features

JuMP 0.22 has a range of new features, most of which are minor. Here is a
summary of the more interesting ones.

### Documentation as a PDF

The documentation is now [available in PDF form](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.22.0/JuMP.pdf)!

Be warned: it's quite a big PDF, and some parts of the formatting need
improving. However, we hope you find it useful. If you have suggestions for how
the documentation could be improved, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/new)
or join the [developer chatroom](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/JuMP-dev).

### Exported status codes

Ever been annoyed at the fact you had to use the `MOI.` prefix in places like:
```julia
if termination_status(model) == MOI.OPTIMAL
    # do stufff
end
```

JuMP now re-exports `MOI.TerminationStatusCode` and `MOI.ResultStatusCode`, so
you can use
```julia
import JuMP
if JuMP.termination_status(model) == JuMP.OPTIMAL
    # do stufff
end
```
or
```julia
using JuMP
if termination_status(model) == OPTIMAL
    # do stufff
end
```

Note that `JuMP.OPTIMAL === MOI.OPTIMAL`, so this is not a breaking change; all
existing code will continue to work.

### Set inequality syntax

JuMP has long had support for specifying constraints about positive semidefinite
(PSD) matrices. In versions prior to JuMP v0.22, there were two options to
enforce  the constraint that the matrix `X - Y` was PSD:
```julia
@constraint(model, X -  Y in PSDCone())
@SDconstraint(model, X >= Y)
```
JuMP v0.22 deprecates all usages of `@SDconstraint`,  introducing a more general
syntax for specifing set inequalities. For example:
```julia
@SDconstraint(model, X >= Y)
# becomes
@constraint(model, X >= Y, PSDCone())
```
This works with any vector-valued cone (e.g., `SecondOrderCone()`), so that the following two are
equivalent:
```julia
@constraint(model, X - Y in SomeSet())
@constraint(model, X >= Y, SomeSet())
```
We think this provides a simpler interface for people modeling set inequalities,
and one that more closely matches what they have written down on paper.

## Next steps

We're getting close to a release of JuMP v1.0.

Our next steps are:
 * Wait a while for people to use this release and report any bugs.
 * Tag  a release of MathOptInterface v1.0
 * Tag v1.0 releases of all the solver wrappers
 * Tag a JuMP v1.0 release!
