JuMP-dev 2026 will be held Sunday, May 31 and Monday June 1, 2026 in Edinburgh,
Scotland.

This is the weekend prior to [SIAM OP26](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/op26/),
which will be held June 2-5, 2026 in Edinburgh, Scotland.

JuMP-dev will be co-located with the [2026 HiGHS Workshop](https://workshop26.highs.dev).

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software
aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In
particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core
development team.

All participants will uphold the [JuMP Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How do I give a talk?

Similarly to previous years, we invite participants to present work related
to JuMP.

**[Submit a talk for JuMP-dev 2026](https://forms.gle/15ya51ZerfrPJAkG7).**
**Talk submissions close January 31, 2026.**

We especially seek talks about JuMP applications and providing feedback on the
user-experience of using JuMP in industry and teaching.

Speakers are encouraged to highlight the challenges faced and lessons learned,
not only successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity
with JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

If you have an idea for a talk and are not sure if it will be of interest, ask
the program committee by writing to `jump-dev-2026@googlegroups.com`.
