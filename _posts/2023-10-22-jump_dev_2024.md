JuMP-dev 2024 was held 19-21 July, 2024 in Montréal, Canada. This was
immediately prior to [ISMP 2024](https://ismp2024.gerad.ca).

The workshop was organized with the help of the [GERAD research center](https://www.gerad.ca/en).

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software
aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In
particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core
development team.

All participants will uphold the [JuMP Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How do I give a talk?

**Talk submission has closed. Accepted talks will be notified in mid-February, 2024.**

Similarly to previous years, we invite participants to present work related
to JuMP.

We especially seek talks about JuMP applications and providing feedback on the
user-experience of using JuMP in industry and teaching.

Speakers are encouraged to highlight the challenges faced and lessons learned,
not only successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity
with JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

If you have an idea for a talk and are not sure if it will be of interest, ask
the program committee by writing to `jump-dev-2024@googlegroups.com`.
