We are happy to announce the initial `v0.1` release of [HiGHS.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl),
a wrapper for [HiGHS](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/hall/HiGHS/).

HiGHS is a new high-performance open-source linear programming solver being
developed by Julian Hall and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland.

You can try it out as follows:
```julia
import Pkg; Pkg.add("HiGHS")

using JuMP, HiGHS
model = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
set_silent(model)
```

While HiGHS is ready to use today, you should be aware that it is still under
active development. That means it might be slow or unstable on some problems.
However, by reporting these problems you can help make HiGHS better!

To report a problem (e.g., incorrect results, or a crash of the solver),
or make a suggestion for how to improve HiGHS, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl).
To make the problem reproducible, use `JuMP.write_to_file(model, "filename.mps")`
to write your model an MPS file, then upload the MPS file to [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com)
and provide a link to the gist in the GitHub issue.

Stay tuned for more progress!
