# ConstraintProgrammingExtensions 0.6 is released 

_Author: Thibaut Cuvelier (@dourouc05)_

JuMP and MathOptInterface are oriented towards mathematical optimization. 
However, their interface is amenable to other kinds of formalism, including 
constraint programming (CP). Bridging the gap between MOI and constraint programming
is the goal of the 
[ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl)
package. 

Discussions for support of constraint programming in the JuMP ecosystem started
[in 2019](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/2014). The original scope
was quite limited, as it only planned to propose some modeling capabilities to 
JuMP. However, quite soon, it morphed into a larger proposal of a full 
[constraint programming environment](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/2227),
accessible from the same API as JuMP. It also meant giving access to CP solvers. 

Traditional mathematical optimization models focus on (in)equality constraints,
typically linear or convex, with an objective function. Constraint programming 
allows more variety in the kind of constraints that are supported, with a 
focus on discrete structure: the best-known constraint is probably `all_different`, 
which models the fact that several integer-valued variables should take different
values (no two variables are allowed to have the same value). Efficient
solvers can be written for this kind of model.

In the last few months, the CP ecosystem in JuMP made tremendous progress,
some of them have been presented at JuliaCon 2021 and its JuMP workshop. 

- The lowest layer, 
  [ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl](https://github.com/dourouc05/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl),
  has [dozens of constraint types available](http://tcuvelier.be/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl/dev/reference/sets/)
  and [dozens of bridges between constraints](http://tcuvelier.be/ConstraintProgrammingExtensions.jl/dev/reference/bridges_sets/),
  including many bridges to convert CP models into standard MIP models.
  It supports the FlatZinc file format, a standard in constraint programming to exchange
  models (similar to the LP and MPS formats for linear programming), both to read and 
  write models, but also to communicate with solvers. It has recently been updated
  to be compatible with MOI 0.10. 
  [It has been presented at the JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0lO6HdlFAw&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=104).
  
- Several solvers are accessible using this API: the pure-Julia 
  [ConstraintSolver.jl](https://github.com/Wikunia/ConstraintSolver.jl/) 
  ([it has been presented at the JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXqQc8bi_vw&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=101)), 
  the industry standard [IBM CPLEX CP Optimizer](https://github.com/dourouc05/CPLEXCP.jl/), 
  and the open-source [Chuffed](https://github.com/dourouc05/Chuffed.jl/).
  
- Other pure-Julia CP solvers have been released, but they do not yet use the same API:
  [JuliaConstraints](https://github.com/JuliaConstraints) 
  ([it has been presented at the JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4siuvNMj0c&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=4)) 
  and [SeaPerl](https://github.com/corail-research/SeaPearl.jl). 
  
This is not the end of the journey. Although MOI and JuMP are nearing their 1.0 
release, the CP ecosystem has still a long way to go. In the near term, more
modelling features should be added as extensions to JuMP and more solvers should
be made accessible. In the longer term, CP modelling will also benefit from 
the new generation of nonlinear support.
