The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have signed an
agreement with [National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR)](https://www.nlr.gov)
to maintain and support JuMP.

The objective of this project is to significantly improve the computational
performance and code quality of NLR’s open-source project PowerSimulations.jl
and the JuMP ecosystem.

The agreement runs until October 2026, and the person being funded is
[Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a core contributor to JuMP, and
also a member of the Steering Committee.

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar, who is funded by the grant, recused himself from Steering Committee votes
on this agreement.)
