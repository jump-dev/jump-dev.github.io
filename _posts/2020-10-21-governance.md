Recently, JuMP turned eight years old. (The [first commit](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/commit/688b732c13abf7182e438ca22b0b00890a08be63)
for "Julp" was made on 10 October 2012!) It has come a long way since it's
creation as a side-project of two graduate students at MIT, and as we approach
a 1.0 release, we thought it was time to formalize our governance structure.

You can find the resulting document under the [Governance tab](/pages/governance)
at [jump.dev](https://jump.dev).

The highlights include:

 * Appointing Miles Lubin as our [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life).

 * Defining entities such as the core contributors, emeritus core contributors,
   repository maintainers, and the Steering Committee, along with their roles,
   and how membership is determined for each entity.

 * Clarifying our decision-making process, by describing who gets to decide what
   when.

 * Listing what Github permissions different entities have to the repositories
   in the [jump-dev](https://github.com/jump-dev) Github organization.

 * Outlining channels of community involvement, including the poorly publicized
   fact that we hold a monthly developer call.

 * Formalizing a process for transferring repositories to the
   [jump-dev](https://github.com/jump-dev) Github organization.

We believe this document strengthens the foundation of JuMP, and sets it up for
a sustainable, long-term future.

Stay tuned for more progress!
