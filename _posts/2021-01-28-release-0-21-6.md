We are happy to announce the release of JuMP 0.21.6. This should be a
non-breaking release, please let us know if this isn't the case by
[opening a Github issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/new/choose)
or joining the [developer chatroom](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/JuMP-dev).

A key feature of interest is that we have significantly revised our
documentation, including [examples that are now built in the documentation](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.6/examples/basic/).
We hope to make much more progress improving the documentation over the coming
months, so if you have suggestions for how things could be improved, please
reach out.

A summary of the changes are as follows:

- New features:
  * Added support for skew symmetric variables via
    `@variable(model, X[1:2, 1:2] in SkewSymmetricMatrixSpace())`.
  * `lp_sensitivity_report` has been added which significantly improves the
    performance of querying the sensitivity summary of an LP.
    `lp_objective_perturbation_range` and `lp_rhs_perturbation_range` are
    deprecated.
  * Dual warm-starts are now supported with `set_dual_start_value` and
    `dual_start_value`.
  * `âˆˆ` (`\in<tab>`) can now be used in macros instead of `=` or `in`.
  * Use `haskey(model::Model, key::Symbol)` to check if a name `key` is
    registered in a model.
  * Added `unregister(model::Model, key::Symbol)` to unregister a name `key`
    from `model`.
  * Added `callback_node_status` for use in callbacks.
  * Added `print_bridge_graph` to visualize the bridging graph generated by
    MathOptInterface.
  * Improved error message for containers with duplicate indices.
- Bug fixes:
  * Various fixes to pass tests on Julia 1.6.
  * Fixed a bug in the printing of nonlinear expressions in IJulia.
  * Fixed a bug when nonlinear expressions are passed to user-defined functions.
  * Some internal functions that were unintentionally exported are now no longer
    exported.
  * Fixed a bug when relaxing a fixed binary variable.
  * Fixed a `StackOverflowError` that occured when `SparseAxisArray`s had a
    large number of elements.
  * Removed an unnecessary type assertion in `list_of_constraint_types`.
  * Fixed a bug when copying models with registered expressions.
- Documentation and general maintenance:
  * The documentation has been significantly overhauled. It now has distinct
    sections for the manual, API reference, and examples. The existing examples
    in `/examples` have now been moved to `/docs/src/examples` and rewritten
    using `Literate.jl`, and they are now included in the documentation.
  * JuliaFormatter has been applied to most of the codebase. This will continue
    to roll out over time, as we fix upstream issues in the formatter, and will
    eventually become compulsory.
  * The root cause of a large number of method invalidations has been resolved.
  * We switched continuous integration from Travis and Appveyor to Github
    Actions.

getting close!)

Stay tuned for more progress!
