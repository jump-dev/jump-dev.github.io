We are happy to announce the release of JuMP 1.15.0.

This is a very large minor release because it adds an entirely new data
structure and API path for working with nonlinear programs.

The previous nonlinear interface remains unchanged and is documented at
[Nonlinear Modeling (Legacy)](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1.15.0/manual/nlp/). The
new interface is a treated as a non-breaking feature addition and is documented
at [Nonlinear Modeling](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1.15.0/manual/nonlinear/).

## Background

The "legacy" nonlinear interface was some of the oldest code in JuMP. When we
created MathOptInterface (and rewrote nearly all of JuMP), we explicitly decided
to leave the nonlinear interface as it was, and "come back to it later."

Over the years, the limitations of JuMP's nonlinear interface have been a
constant source of frustration for users. Why could you only create nonlinear
expressions in the `@NL` macros? Why were the `@NLconstraint` and `@NLobjective`
macros needed instead of the normal `@constraint` and `@objective`? Why could
you not use `sum(::Vector)` or compute a dot product inside a nonlinear macro?
The [discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt/13) is filled
with questions, hacks, and work-arounds for all things related to nonlinear
programming.

Two years ago, and motivated by this public demand, we received funding from
[Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://jump.dev/announcements/2022/02/21/lanl/)
to begin a rewrite of JuMP's nonlinear interface with the goal of bringing
first-class nonlinear support to JuMP. This release is the culmination of that
work.

## Highlights

Here are some highlights of the new features.

### Operator overloading

Nonlinear expressions can be defined outside of macros like their quadratic and
affine counterparts:

```julia
julia> using JuMP

julia> model = Model();

julia> @variable(model, x);

julia> expr = x^2.3 + sin(x)
(x ^ 2.3) + sin(x)

julia> typeof(expr)
NonlinearExpr (alias for GenericNonlinearExpr{GenericVariableRef{Float64}})

julia> expr.head
:+

julia> expr.args
2-element Vector{Any}:
 x ^ 2.3
 sin(x)
```

### Macro definitions

We can define nonlinear expressions inside of `@expression`, `@objective`, and
`@constraint`. The special `@NL` macros are no longer required.

```julia
julia> @expression(model, x + x^3 * sin(x)^x)
x + ((x ^ 3) * (sin(x) ^ x))
```

### LinearAlgebra support

We can also do linear algebra operations:

```julia
julia> @variable(model, X[1:3, 1:2]);

julia> @variable(model, v[1:3]);

julia> @variable(model, w[1:2]);

julia> @expression(model, v' * X * w)
0.0 + ((X[1,1]*v[1] + X[2,1]*v[2] + X[3,1]*v[3]) * w[1]) + ((X[1,2]*v[1] + X[2,2]*v[2] + X[3,2]*v[3]) * w[2])
```

including broadcasting:

```julia
julia> @variable(model, Z[1:2, 1:2], Symmetric);

julia> @objective(model, Min, sum(Z^4 .- Z.^3))
0.0 + (((+(0.0) + (((+(0.0) + ((Z[1,2]) * (Z[1,1]))) + ...
# ... long expression not shown ...
```

### Function tracing

Because we support operator overloading, calling a regular Julia function with
JuMP variables produces a nonnlinear expression:

```julia
julia> my_func(y) = 2^y + exp(y^-2.3);

julia> my_func(2.0)
5.225149771643138

julia> my_func(x)
(2.0 ^ x) + exp(x ^ -2.3)
```

Function tracing should greatly simplify a number of nonlinear models. For
example, the model in [this Discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/is-there-a-symbolics-jl-interface-to-ipopt-or-similar/100149/17?u=odow)
becomes:
```julia
using JuMP, Ipopt
function example()
    Q = -0.8:0.4:0.8
    model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)
    set_silent(model)
    @variable(model, -2 <= p[1:5] <= 2)
    @variable(model, -1 <= w <= 3)
    @variable(model, -1 <= q <= 3)
    @objective(model, Min, w)
    f(p, q) = (1 / sqrt(2π)) * exp(-((p - q)^2) / 2)
    total(p, q) = sum(_p * f(i, q) for (i, _p) in enumerate(p))
    l1(p, q) = 1 - total(p, q) + 0.5 * total(p, 0.5)
    l2(p, q) = total(p, q) - 1
    lhs(p, q, _q) = l1(p, q) - l1(p, _q)
    @constraint(model, [_q in Q], w * lhs(p, q, _q) + (1 - w) * l2(p, q) <= 0)
    optimize!(model)
    return
end
```

### User-defined operators

To prevent tracing, you can create an operator instead:

```julia
julia> my_func2(a) = sin(a) * eta(a);

julia> @operator(model, op_my_func, 1, my_func2)
NonlinearOperator(my_func2, :op_my_func)

julia> @expression(model, op_my_func(x)^2)
op_my_func(x) ^ 2.0
```

### Vector-valued nonlinear functions

We now support multi-objective programs with nonlinear objectives:
```julia
julia> model = Model();

julia> @variable(model, x[1:4]);

julia> @objective(model, Min, [sum(abs.(x)), sqrt(sum(x.^2))])
2-element Vector{NonlinearExpr}:
 (((+(0.0) + abs(x[1])) + abs(x[2])) + abs(x[3])) + abs(x[4])
 sqrt(x[1]² + x[2]² + x[3]² + x[4]²)
```

and we support nonlinear mixed complementarity problems

```julia
julia> model = Model();

julia> @variable(model, x >= 0);

julia> @constraint(model, log(x + 0.1) ⟂ x)
[log(x + 0.1), +(x)] ∈ MathOptInterface.Complements(2)
```

## Potential breaking changes

Although the new nonlinear interface is a feature addition, there are two
changes which might be breaking for a very small number of users.

 - The syntax inside JuMP macros is parsed using a different code path, even for
   linear and quadratic expressions. We made this change to unify how we parse
   linear, quadratic, and nonlinear expressions. In all cases, the new code
   returns equivalent expressions, but because of the different order of
   operations, there are three changes to be aware of when updating:
    - The printed form of the expression may change, for example from `x * y` to
      `y * x`. This can cause tests which test the `String` representation of a
      model to fail.
    - Some coefficients may change slightly due to floating point round-off
      error.
    - Particularly when working with a JuMP extension, you may encounter a
      `MethodError` due to a missing or ambiguous method. These errors are due
      to previously existing bugs that were not triggered by the previous
      parsing code. If you encounter such an error, please open a GitHub issue.
 - The methods for `Base.:^(x::VariableRef, n::Integer)` and
   `Base.:^(x::AffExpr, n::Integer)` have changed. Previously, these methods
   supported only `n = 0, 1, 2` and they always returned a `QuadExpr`,
   even for the case when `n = 0` or `n = 1`. Now:
     - `x^0` returns `one(T)`, where `T` is the `value_type` of the
       model (defaults to `Float64`)
     - `x^1` returns `x`
     - `x^2` returns a `QuadExpr`
     - `x^n` where `!(0 <= n <= 2)` returns a `NonlinearExpr`.
   We made this change to support nonlinear expressions and to align the
   mathematical definition of the operation with their return type. (Previously,
   users were surprised that `x^1` returned a `QuadExpr`.) As a
   consequence of this change, the methods are now not type-stable. This means
   that the compiler cannot prove that `x^2` returns a `QuadExpr`. If
   benchmarking shows that this is a performance problem, you can use the
   type-stable `x * x` instead of `x^2`.

## Next steps
