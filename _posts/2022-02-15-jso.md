In February's edition of the JuMP nonlinear developers call, [Tangi Migot](https://github.com/tmigot/tmigot)
and [Alexis Amontoison](https://github.com/amontoison) discussed the
[JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers) ecosystem.

## Abstract

In this talk, we will give an overview of the Github organization JuliaSmoothOptimizers and its 37 packages. In particular, we will focus on its NLPModel.jl API used to represent a nonlinear continuous optimization model independently of its origin. We illustrate a use-case with NLPModelsJuMP.jl, which translates any JuMP.jl / MathOptInterface.jl NLP model to NLPModels.
