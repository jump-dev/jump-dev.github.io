The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have signed an
agreement with [PSR](https://psr-inc.com) to provide maintenance and support for
JuMP and the surrounding ecosystem.

PSR is a global provider of consulting services, computational modeling and
energy innovation; and actively contributes to research and development of
optimization and data analytics solutions.

The agreement between PSR and JuMP is part of a larger project for the
[Câmara de Comercilização de Energia Elétrica](https://www.ccee.org.br)'s "Study
on the formation of short-term electricity prices: an analysis of the Brazilian
market." You can find more information on the project's
[website (Portuguese)](https://www.meta2formacaodepreco.com.br).

The agreement runs from January 2024 to March of 2025.

The first person being funded is [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a
core contributor to JuMP, and also a member of the Steering Committee.

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar, who is funded by the grant, recused himself from Steering Committee votes
on this agreement.)
