We are happy to announce the joint release of JuMP 0.21.4 and MathOptInterface
0.9.15! These releases are a mix of new features and some much needed
performance optimizations. This should be a non-breaking release, please let us
know if this isn't the case by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/new/choose)
or joining the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/JuMP-dev).

On the JuMP side, new features of interest include
* the `relax_integrality` function, which relaxes all integrality constraints in
the model. This is useful for solving the LP relaxation of a MIP.
* the `compute_conflict!` function, which exposes the ability of some solvers to
compute an irreducible infeasible subsystem of an infeasible model. This is very
useful when debugging, and we expect more work in the future to refine a
user-friendly API.

We also spent time improving the [time](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2279)

[fixing bugs](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2271), and
[improving error messages](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2276).

On the MathOptInterface side, we spent the majority of the last few months
working on performance improvements. These changes include: [faster reading and
writing of MathOptFormat files](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1111);
specialized `copy_to` methods for [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl/pull/94)
and [GLPK](https://github.com/jump-dev/GLPK.jl/pull/143), which reduces the time
taken to copy the problem from JuMP into the solver; and numerous minor changes
to the backend of MathOptInterface, such as specialized dictionaries which act
like arrays at first, [but switch to dictionaries when elements are deleted](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1142).

[@blegat](https://github.com/blegat) also implemented an option that changes the
way to compute which bridges to use in a transformation, opening the way for us
to experiment with different bridging schemes in the future.

On the solver front, the conic solver SCS in particular received a
[lot](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/182)

We also have a number of contributors to thank.
* [@ilancoulon](https://github.com/ilancoulon) took a [deep dive into the bridging
system](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1101)
* [@rtwalker](https://github.com/rtwalker) implemented a new bridge to [convert
between `ZeroOne` and `Integer` constraints](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1099)
* [@dourouc05](https://github.com/dourouc05) completed a multi-year odyssey
to [expose irreducible infeasible subsystems (IIS)](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2300).
He also made a number of [other](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1149)
[fixes](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2317)
and [documentation](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2316)
[improvements](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2264).
* [@yashcodes](https://github.com/yashcodes) made some [helpful](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2222)
[improvements](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2203) to JuMP's error
messages and the [documentation in MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1050).
* [@egbuck](https://github.com/egbuck) [fixed a bug](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1124)
in objective support for various file formats.
* [@andrewrosemberg](https://github/com/andrewrosemberg) [fixed a bug](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2319)
that affected heuristic callbacks.
