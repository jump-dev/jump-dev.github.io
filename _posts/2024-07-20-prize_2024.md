The [JuMP-dev 2024 workshop](/meetings/jumpdev2024) introduced a new best
presentation prize.

The prize was awarded to two presentations:

 * Truls Flatberg and SINTEF for the talk
   [Applied optimization with JuMP at SINTEF](https://youtu.be/-a9-ToFiT8E).
   The presentation highlighted long-term initiatives to use JuMP for applied
   projects and to push the culture of the organization towards open-source
   solutions. We also recognize SINTEF's ongoing contributions back to the
   community that have influenced the direction of JuMP development.
 * Joshua Pulsipher, Sungho Shin, François Pacaud and Mihai Anitescu for the talk
   [InfiniteExaModels.jl: Accelerating Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Problems on CPU & GPU](https://youtu.be/XBPTb_nbrUs).
   This work embodied the spirit of JuMP's earliest development by demonstrating
   the importance of the connection between modeling and solvers to advance the
   state of the art in optimization and by using the unique features of Julia to
   achieve this performance.

Congratulations!
