The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have received a
large grant from the [Breakthrough Energy Foundation](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org)
to improve the performance of JuMP and [HiGHS](https://highs.dev) on open energy
models. This grant is an extension of our previous work on
[open energy modeling](/announcements/open-energy-modeling/2024/09/16/oem/).

The agreement runs for one year, and the people being funded are:

* [Dr. Julian Hall](https://github.com/jajhall), the lead developer of the
  HiGHS solver
* [Dr. Ivet Galabova](https://github.com/galabova), the HiGHS Integration and
  Development manager
* [Dr. Mark Turner](https://github.com/Opt-Mucca), a HiGHS MIP developer
* [Dr. Filippo Zanetti](https://github.com/filikat), the developer of HiPO
* [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a core contributor to JuMP, and
  also a member of the Steering Committee.

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar and Julian, who are funded by the grant, recused themselves from Steering
Committee votes on this agreement.)
