We are pleased to announce that JuMP-dev 2022 will be co-located with
[JuliaCon 2022](https://juliacon.org/2022)!

This year JuliaCon is virtual, and will be held 27-29 July, 2022.

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## How do I attend?

JuliaCon 2022 is entirely virtual and free to attend, but
[registration is required](https://juliacon.org/2022/tickets/).

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2022/coc/).

## Schedule

All talks at JuMP-dev will be played live on Youtube at the times below.
[Register for JuliaCon](https://juliacon.org/2022/tickets/) to receive a link
and instructions for how to watch. After the event, we will replace the "Time"
column with links to the recorded videos.

Note that these times are subject to change. See [the JuliaCon schedule](https://live.juliacon.org/agenda)
for the definitive schedule.
