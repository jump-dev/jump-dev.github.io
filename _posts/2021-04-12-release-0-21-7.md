We are happy to announce the release of JuMP 0.21.7. This should be a
non-breaking release, please let us know if this isn't the case by
[opening a Github issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/new/choose)
or joining the [developer chatroom](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/JuMP-dev).

A key feature of interest is that we have continued to significantly revise our
documentation. The [Nonlinear Modeling](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.7/manual/nlp/#Nonlinear-Modeling) 
section is now much clearer, and there are now [integrated tutorials](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.7/tutorials/Getting%20started/an_introduction_to_julia/).
If you have suggestions for how things could be further improved, please reach 
out.

A summary of changes are as follows:

- New features:
  * Added `primal_feasibility_report`, which can be used to check whether a
    primal point satisfies primal feasibility.
  * Added `coefficient`, which returns the coefficient associated with a
    variable in affine and quadratic expressions.
  * Added `copy_conflict`, which returns the IIS of an infeasible model.
  * Added `solution_summary`, which returns (and prints) a struct containing a
    summary of the solution.
  * Allow `AbstractVector` in vector constraints instead of just `Vector`.
  * Added `latex_formulation(model)` which returns an object representing the
    latex formulation of a model. Use `print(latex_formulation(model))` to print
    the formulation as a string.
  * User-defined functions in nonlinear expressions are now automatically
    registered to aid quick model prototyping. However, a warning is printed to
    encourage the manual registration.
  * DenseAxisArray's now support broadcasting over multiple arrays.
  * Container indices can now be iterators of `Base.SizeUnknown`.
- Bug fixes:
  * Fixed bug in `rad2deg` and `deg2rad` in nonlinear expressions.
  * Fixed a MethodError bug in `Containers` when forcing container type.
  * Allow partial slicing of a DenseAxisArray, resolving an issue from 2014!
  * Fixed a bug printing variable names in IJulia.
  * Ending an IJulia cell with `model` now prints a summary of the model (like
    in the REPL) not the latex formulation. Use `print(model)` to print the latex
    formulation.
  * Fixed a bug when copying models containing nested arrays.
- Documentation, performance improvements, and general maintenance:
  * Tutorials are now part of the documentation, and more refactoring has taken
    place.
  * Added JuliaFormatter added as a code formatter.
  * Added some precompilation statements to reduce initial latency.
  * Various improvements to error messages to make them more helpful.
  * Improved performance of `value(::NonlinearExpression)`.
  * Improved performance of `fix(::VariableRef)`.

This release knocks out a number of major items on our
[roadmap](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.7/developers/roadmap/) for JuMP 1.0. 
(We're getting close!)

Stay tuned for more progress!
