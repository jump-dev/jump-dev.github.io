Last year at [JuMP-dev 2024](/meetings/jumpdev2024) we started what we hope will
be a tradition of giving the [JuMP-dev prize](/prize/jump-dev-2024). This year we
did a little more advance planning and purchased two children's jump ropes,
which will be the physical manifestation of this year's prize.

The prize committee was the set of core developers, and we decided on two
winners:

 * Alexis Montoison, for both his [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjUmNqfoXy4)
   [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qEwygP0nxo), and for his extensive
   contributions to the Julia and JuMP communities.

 * Harley Mackenzie, for [telling us in a very low-key way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seqc_kH-jIw)
   about how he integrated JuMP into his [system for operating utility-scale wind
   and solar farms in the Australian National Energy Market](https://www.hardsoftware.com)
   without asking for any help from us.

Congratulations!
