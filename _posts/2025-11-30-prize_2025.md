Last year at [JuMP-dev 2024](/meetings/jumpdev2024) we started what we hope will
be a tradition of giving the [JuMP-dev prize](/prize/jump-dev-2024). This year we
did a little more advance planning and purchased two children's jump ropes,
which will be the phyiscal manifestation of the prize.

The prize committee was the set of core developers, and we decided on two
winners:

 * Alexis Montoison, for both his [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjUmNqfoXy4)
   [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qEwygP0nxo), and for his extensive
   contributions to the Julia and JuMP communities.

 * Harley Mackenzie, for [telling us in a very low-key way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seqc_kH-jIw)
   about how you integrated JuMP into your system without even asking for any
   help from us. That's the best kind of user, although bug reports and feature
   requests are always appreciated.

Congratulations!
