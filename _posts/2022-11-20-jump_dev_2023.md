We are pleased to announce that JuMP-dev 2023 will be co-located with
[JuliaCon 2023](https://juliacon.org/2023)!

This year, JuliaCon is being held in person, 24-29 July, 2023 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
You can find more information on the [conference website](https://juliacon.org/2023/).

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## How do I attend?

To attend JuMP-dev, you must purchase a ticket to JuliaCon 2023. Ticket sales
will open in early 2023.

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2023/coc/).

## Travel support

To encourage people to attend JuMP-dev, we have funds to provide travel support
to a limited number of applicants.

We particularly encourage people who have not been to a JuMP-dev before to
apply.

[Apply for travel support](https://forms.gle/1pWBhu3VwBUophFV7)

The deadline for applications is January 31st.

## How do I give a talk?

**To give a talk, [submit a proposal to JuliaCon](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2023/cfp)**
**For "Session type," choose "Talk" or "Lightning talk." For "Track," choose**
**"JuMP."**

The deadline for talk submissions is January 15, 2023.

Similarly to [previous](/meetings/mit2017) [iterations](/meetings/bordeaux2018)
[of](/meetings/santiago2019) [the](/meetings/juliacon2021) [workshop](/meetings/juliacon2022),
we invite participants to present work related to JuMP. In particular, we
especially seek talks related to:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 2.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia
- Julia interfaces to mathematical optimization solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Software that uses JuMP
- Developer tools for JuMP
- Commercial use of JuMP
- Uses of JuMP in teaching

Speakers are encouraged to highlight challenges and lessons learned, not only
successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity with
JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

See the previous workshops for examples of accepted talks: [2017](/meetings/mit2017/),
[2018](/meetings/bordeaux2018/), [2019](/meetings/santiago2019),
[2021](/meetings/juliacon2021), and [2022](/meetings/juliacon2022).
