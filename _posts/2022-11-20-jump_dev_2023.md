JuMP-dev 2023 was held in person, 27-29 July, 2023 in Cambridge,
Massachusetts. It was co-located with [JuliaCon 2023](https://juliacon.org/2023).

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## Schedule

The full JuliaCon ran from July 25-29, and JuMP-dev specific events were
scheduled on July 27-29.

Talks given at JuMP-dev were recorded and are available on YouTube:

## How do I attend?

To attend JuMP-dev, you must purchase a ticket to JuliaCon 2023. Ticket sales
will open in early 2023. Accepted speakers at JuMP-dev will receive a free
ticket.

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2023/coc/).

## How do I give a talk?

Talk submissions have now closed.

Similarly to [previous](/meetings/mit2017) [iterations](/meetings/bordeaux2018)
[of](/meetings/santiago2019) [the](/meetings/juliacon2021) [workshop](/meetings/juliacon2022),
we invite participants to present work related to JuMP. In particular, we
especially seek talks related to:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 2.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia
- Julia interfaces to mathematical optimization solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Software that uses JuMP
- Developer tools for JuMP
- Commercial use of JuMP
- Uses of JuMP in teaching

Speakers are encouraged to highlight challenges and lessons learned, not only
successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity with
JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

See the previous workshops for examples of accepted talks: [2017](/meetings/mit2017/),
[2018](/meetings/bordeaux2018/), [2019](/meetings/santiago2019),
[2021](/meetings/juliacon2021), and [2022](/meetings/juliacon2022).
