We are pleased to announce that JuMP-dev 2021 will be co-located with
[JuliaCon 2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/)!

This year JuliaCon is virtual, and will be held 28-30 July, 2021.

## Outline 

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## Watch the talks

You can watch all of the talks for JuMP-dev 2021 in this Youtube playlist:

## How do I attend?

JuliaCon 2021 is entirely virtual and free to attend, but
[registration is required](https://juliacon.org/2021/tickets/).

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/).

## Where is the schedule?

Talks for JuMP-dev are scheduled under the “JuMP-dev” track of JuliaCon.
See [https://pretalx.com/juliacon2021/schedule/](https://pretalx.com/juliacon2021/schedule/).

## How do I watch the talks?

Links will be made available on the JuliaCon website:
[https://juliacon.org/2021/](https://juliacon.org/2021/).

The talks will also be on YouTube if you can’t watch live.

## How to I ask questions of the speaker?

First, register for JuliaCon. 

Registering will allow you to access the Discord server (link still to come...)
where there will be a JuMP-dev chatroom to talk to the core developers
and ask questions.

## How to give a talk

**Talk submissions have now closed.**

Similarly to [previous](/meetings/mit2017) [iterations](/meetings/bordeaux2018)
of the [workshop](/meetings/santiago2019), we invite participants to present
work related to JuMP. In particular, we especially seek talks related to:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (e.g., Cassette, Zygote)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Developer tools for JuMP
- Commercial use of JuMP
- JuMP for teaching

Speakers are encouraged to highlight challenges and lessons learned, not only
successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity with
JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

See the [previous](/meetings/mit2017/) [JuMP-dev](/meetings/bordeaux2018/)
[workshops](/meetings/santiago2019) for examples of accepted talks.
