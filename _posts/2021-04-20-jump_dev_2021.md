We are pleased to announce that JuMP-dev 2021 will be co-located with
[JuliaCon 2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/)!

This year JuliaCon is virtual, and will be held 28-30 July, 2021.

## Outline 

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## How to attend

JuliaCon 2021 is entirely virtual and free to attend, but
[registration is required](https://juliacon.org/2021/tickets/).

Logistically, JuMP-dev will function as a separate track of JuliaCon. By
registering for JuliaCon you can attend talks at JuMP-dev and JuliaCon.

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/).

## How to give a talk

Talk submissions have now closed.
