We are pleased to announce that JuMP-dev 2021 will be co-located with
[JuliaCon 2021](https://juliacon.org/2021/)!

This year JuliaCon is virtual, and will be held 28-30 July, 2021.

## Outline 

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the software aspects of
[JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In particular,
we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## How to attend

JuliaCon 2021 is entirely virtual and free to attend, but
[registration is required](https://juliacon.org/2021/tickets/).

Logistically, JuMP-dev will function as a separate track of JuliaCon. By
registering for JuliaCon you can attend talks at JuMP-dev and JuliaCon.

All participants will uphold the [JuliaCon Code of Conduct](https://juliacon.org/2021/coc/).

## How to give a talk

**Talk submissions have now closed.**

Similarly to [previous](/meetings/mit2017) [iterations](/meetings/bordeaux2018)
of the [workshop](/meetings/santiago2019), we invite participants to present
work related to JuMP. In particular, we especially seek talks related to:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (e.g., Cassette, Zygote)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Developer tools for JuMP
- Commercial use of JuMP
- JuMP for teaching

Speakers are encouraged to highlight challenges and lessons learned, not only
successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity with
JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

See the [previous](/meetings/mit2017/) [JuMP-dev](/meetings/bordeaux2018/)
[workshops](/meetings/santiago2019) for examples of accepted talks.
