First, we hope that everyone is safe in these uncertain times. Our first
priority will always be the health and well-being of the JuMP community.
Therefore, we regret to announce that we have decided to cancel [JuMP-dev 2020](/meetings/louvain2020).

Even though there are conceivable scenarios in which travel restrictions are
lifted in Europe before June 15th, we feel that there would not be sufficient
time to organize the conference, nor for attendees to book their travel with certainty.

However, JuMP-dev 2021 is just around the corner! It will be held in January,
2021 (exact dates TBD) in conjunction with the University of South Florida, in
Tampa, Florida. More details to follow.

Finally, we will not let the summer pass us by! We are very close to releasing
JuMP 1.0. Therefore, we plan on holding a series of weekend coding sprints
through the late-spring and summer, with the view to releasing JuMP 1.0 in the
fall. Further details of these sprints will be announced in due course, but I
invite you all to contribute to the final development of JuMP 1.0!
