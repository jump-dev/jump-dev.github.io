JuMP-dev 2025 will be held November 17--20, 2025 in Auckland, New Zealand.

This is the week following [CPAIOR 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025),
which will be held November 10--13, 2025 in Melbourne, Australia. (Melbourne is
a 4 hour flight and 2 hour time difference from New Zealand.)

## Outline

The purpose of JuMP-dev is to bring together students, researchers, and
practitioners with interests in the methodological, algorithmic, and software
aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl) and related packages. In
particular, we invite new contributors and those who have not met the core
development team.

All participants will uphold the [JuMP Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Schedule

The workshop will be structured as two days of talks, a hackathon, and a local
excursion. The schedule is subject to change at any time.

 * Monday 17 November: talks at [GridAKL](#venue)

## How do I give a talk?

Similarly to previous years, we invite participants to present work related

**Talk submissions are now open, and they will close on February 28, 2025.

**[Submit a talk for JuMP-dev 2025](https://forms.gle/SzbqwzfsRNW97PZt5)**

We especially seek talks about JuMP applications and providing feedback on the
user-experience of using JuMP in industry and teaching.

Speakers are encouraged to highlight the challenges faced and lessons learned,
not only successes. Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity
with JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

If you have an idea for a talk and are not sure if it will be of interest, ask
the program committee by writing to `jump-dev-2025@googlegroups.com`.
