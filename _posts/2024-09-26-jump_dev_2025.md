take place November 20--21, 2025, also in Auckland, New Zealand.

### Accommodation

There are a wide range of accommodation options within walking distance.

### Airport transfers

The easiest way to get from the Airport to downtown is via the [Sky Drive bus](https://www.skydrive.co.nz).
Tickets are $20, and you can purchase one from the driver.

There are a variety of cheaper but non-direct and slow public transport options.
You can pay for public transport in Auckland with a contactless credit card.
For busses, tag on and off the reader inside the door of each bus. For trains,
some stations have barriers, others have a post at the platforms.

## Excursion

There will be a self-guided excursion on the Wednesday 19 November.

### Option A

Assuming the weather is nice, we will plan to catch the ferry to Devonport, and
walk to the summit of North Head for views over the city and harbor, followed by
lunch in Devonport.

Meet at the [downtown ferry terminal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gh2nnbSdZqj6yzsW7) at 10:30.

### Option B

If you want a more adventurous (but highly recommended) option, catch the ferry
to Tiritiri Matangi island. This island has been cleared of all introduced pests
and has many native New Zealand birds. You must [book tickets in advance from explore](https://www.exploregroup.co.nz/auckland/tiritiri-matangi-island/)
($110 return) and take your own food.

## New Zealand entry requirements

If you require a visa, please email `jump-dev-2025@googlegroups.com` with the
subject `Visa invitation letter`.

Regardless of your visa status, everyone traveling to New Zealand must complete

The easiest way to complete this is via the app. You must complete it no sooner
than 24 hours before starting your travel. If you forget to complete the
declaration prior to traveling, you may request a paper form from the flight
attendants on your flight.
