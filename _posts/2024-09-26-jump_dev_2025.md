Meet at Mt Eden Village at 2pm on the corner of Stokes and Mt Eden roads. The
easiest way to get there is to catch a bus from the city. Enter the bus by the
driver's door and tag on with a contactless credit card. Remember to tag off
when you exit the bus from the back door.

ORSNZ 57 will be simultaneously taking place in the nearby
[University of Auckland Conference Centre](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MQ2TXDx3GYK1funV6).

### Gurobi

The Gurobi Optimization Community roadshow will take place after the hackathon
on November 20.

You must [register in advance at gurobi.com](https://www.gurobi.com/events/the-optimisation-community-auckland/).

### Accommodation

There are a wide range of accommodation options within walking distance.

### Airport transfers

The easiest way to get from the Airport to downtown is via the [Sky Drive bus](https://www.skydrive.co.nz).
Tickets are $20, and you can purchase one from the driver.

There are a variety of cheaper but non-direct and slow public transport options.
You can pay for public transport in Auckland with a contactless credit card.
For busses, tag on and off the reader inside the door of each bus. For trains,
some stations have barriers, others have a post at the platforms.

## Excursion

There will be a self-guided excursion on the Wednesday 19 November.

### Option A

**Option to be decided in the morning.**

If the weather is nice, we will plan to catch the ferry to Devonport and walk to
the summit of North Head for views over the city and harbor, followed by lunch
in Devonport.

<s>Meet at the [downtown ferry terminal](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gh2nnbSdZqj6yzsW7)
at 10:15 (to catch the 10:30 ferry).</s>

<s>If the weather is bad, we will instead catch the ferry to Little Creatures at
[Hobsonville point](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fsdAN57wjqVBsrW7A). Meet at the
ferry terminal at 12:00 (to catch the 12:25 ferry).</s>

### Option B

If you want a more adventurous (but highly recommended) option, catch the ferry
to Tiritiri Matangi island. This island has been cleared of all introduced pests
and has many native New Zealand birds. You must [book tickets in advance from explore](https://www.exploregroup.co.nz/auckland/tiritiri-matangi-island/)
($110 return) and take your own food.

Here is a [map of the island](https://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/parks-and-recreation/places-to-visit/auckland/tiritiri-matangi-map.pdf).
Oscar's recommended route: turn left from the ferry, along Hobbs beach,
up the Kawerau Track and spend time in the native forest, then back along the
cable track for lunch at the lighthouse, finally down the wattle track to meet
the ferry back to the city.
