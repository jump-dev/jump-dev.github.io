We are happy to announce the joint release of JuMP 0.21.5 and MathOptInterface
0.9.17! These releases are a mix of new features and some much needed
performance optimizations. This should be a non-breaking release, please let us
know if this isn't the case by [opening a Github issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/new/choose)
or joining the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/JuliaOpt/JuMP-dev). We did have
a couple of bugs that slipped into a short-lived release, hence the jump (if you
will excuse us) from 0.21.3 to 0.21.5.

On the JuMP side, new features of interest include
* the [`relax_integrality`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.5/variables/#JuMP.relax_integrality)
function, which relaxes all integrality constraints in the model. This restores
the `solve(..., relaxation=true)` functionality from JuMP 0.18.
* the [`compute_conflict!`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.5/solutions/#JuMP.compute_conflict!)
function, which exposes the ability of some solvers to compute an irreducible
infeasible subsystem of an infeasible model.

We also spent time improving the [time](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2279)
[it](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2284)
[takes](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2285)
[to](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2286)
[run](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2303)
[the](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2306)
[tests](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2307) and
[fixing bugs](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2271). We also
[resolved](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2276) a
[long outstanding issue](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/1174) with
reporting correct line numbers in errors involving macros.

On the MathOptInterface side, we spent the majority of the last few months
working on performance improvements. These changes include: [faster reading and
writing of MathOptFormat files](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1111);
specialized `copy_to` methods for [Clp](https://github.com/jump-dev/Clp.jl/pull/94)
and [GLPK](https://github.com/jump-dev/GLPK.jl/pull/143), which reduces the time
taken to copy the problem from JuMP into the solver; and numerous minor changes
to the backend of MathOptInterface, such as specialized dictionaries which act
like arrays at first, [but switch to dictionaries when elements are deleted](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1142).

[@blegat](https://github.com/blegat) also implemented an option that changes the
way to compute which bridges to use in a transformation, opening the way for us
to experiment with different bridging schemes in the future.

On the solver front, the conic solver SCS in particular received a
[lot](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/182)
[of](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/185)
[attention](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/189)
[on](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/191)
[improving](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/192)
[performance](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/pull/196). This led to very
large gains formulating large problems in our benchmarks. In the worst case, a
problem that never finished loading into the solver [now takes 10 seconds](https://github.com/jump-dev/SCS.jl/issues/181).

We also have a number of contributors to thank.
* [@ilancoulon](https://github.com/ilancoulon) took a [deep dive into the bridging system](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1101)
* [@rtwalker](https://github.com/rtwalker) implemented a new bridge to [convert
between `ZeroOne` and `Integer` constraints](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1099)
* [@dourouc05](https://github.com/dourouc05) completed a multi-year odyssey
to [expose irreducible infeasible subsystems (IIS)](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2300).
He also made a number of [other](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1149)
[fixes](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2317)
and [documentation](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2316)
[improvements](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2264).
* [@yashcodes](https://github.com/yashcodes) made some [helpful](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2222)
[improvements](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2203) to JuMP's error
messages and the [documentation in MathOptInterface](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1050).
* [@egbuck](https://github.com/egbuck) [fixed a bug](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/pull/1124)
in objective support for various file formats.
* [@andrewrosemberg](https://github/com/andrewrosemberg) [fixed a bug](https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/pull/2319)
that affected heuristic callbacks.

We also thank testing improvments from [@iainnz](https://github/com/iainnz),
documentation improvements from  [@zlatanvasovic](https://github/com/zlatanvasovic),
[@mtanneau](https://github/com/mtanneau) and [@aks1996](https://github/com/aks1996).
