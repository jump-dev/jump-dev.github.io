_The purpose of this blog post is to document a workflow that I have found
useful during the development and maintenance of solver wrappers. By the time
you read this, it might be out of date, but I hope it's a helpful prod in the
right direction._

## Background

Many JuMP solvers are implemented in compiled languages such as C or C++. We
build and distribute open-source solvers via Julia's excellent
[Yggdrasil build infrastructure](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil).

Yggdrasil is similar to other build systems such as homebrew. Each project that
we want to build gets a separate directory. For example, the conic solver
[embotech/ecos](https://github.com/embotech/ecos) has a directory [E/ECOS](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/blob/master/E/ECOS).
Inside that directory is a [build_tarballs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/blob/master/E/ECOS/build_tarballs.jl)
file, which is a Julia script that describes where to download the source code,
how to compile it, what platforms it should be compiled to, and so on.

The output of running the script is a Julia package, for example, [ECOS_jll.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/ECOS_jll.jl),
and a [set of binary artifacts](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/ECOS_jll.jl/releases/tag/ECOS-v200.0.800%2B0)
with the compiled binaries for each platform. "JLL" packages are regular Julia
packages. The `_jll` suffix is naming convention to signify that they have been
automatically built to distribute compiled binaries.

When you make a pull request to add or edit a `build_tarballs.jl` file on
Yggdrasil, the CI machines start a Linux machine, run your script, and build all
variations required. When the PR is merged, these get uploaded to the associated
`_jll.jl` package and a new release is tagged.

An important point that will soon be relevant is that Yggdrasil cross-compiles
each project from a Linux build to the target platform.

ECOS is a pretty simple project to compile, but we still cross-compile 16
different versions for a variety of different platforms. For example, there are
Windows builds for 32- and 64-bit systems, Mac builds for Intel and ARM
processors, and Linux builds for x64_64, i686, aarch64, armv6l, and armv7l
processors, as well builds that depend on whether the user is running
[glibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc) or [musl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl).
A more compilicated project like [Ipopt_jll](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/Ipopt_jll.jl)
has 85 different versions, with additional builds that depend on the C++ and
Fortran versions used by the linked code.

Once things are built and running, this system works pretty smoothly. But there
are two major issues.

First, upstream solvers may change their compilation workflow, or accidentally
break compilation on some platforms because they do not test on the full suite
of platforms that Yggdrasil supports. This means that small maintenance jobs
like "hey, upstream has released a new version, let's rebuild the JLL" can turn
into long back-and-forth debugging as we attempt to compile, find a bug, develop
a patch, and then either carry it in the JLL build, or upstream it and wait for
a new release.

One solution is for the upstream project to add a GitHub action workflow that
uses the Yggdrasil build script in their CI. This should give upstream advance
notice of compilation failures.  We have already added such workflows [ERGO-Code/HiGHS](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/blob/latest/.github/workflows/julia-tests-ubuntu.yml)
and [cvanaret/Uno](https://github.com/cvanaret/Uno/blob/main/.github/workflows/julia-tests-ubuntu.yml).
As a side benefit, if they build a Linux binary, they can then install related
Julia packages and run their tests to ensure that no breaking changes have been
introduced. For example, the HiGHS script installs and tests [HiGHS.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/HiGHS.jl),
which indirectly provides a few thousand tests of the HiGHS C API.

The second major problem is that cross-compiling from Linux to the target
platforms means that we cannot test the binaries that are built during the
Yggdrasil run. We can ensure only that compilation succeeds, and thus any
runtime bugs cannot be checked or tested against. As one example, [SCIP.jl](https://github.com/scipopt/SCIP.jl)
was unusable on Windows because of a runtime segfault. The debugging step for
this build issue was painful, because it required someone to start a Linux
machine, cross-compile to Windows using Yggdrasil, copy the binaries to a
Windows machine, run, debug, make changes to the Linux build, and repeat. I
developed the following script for use in SCIP.jl to help debug the problem.

At a high level, it starts a Linux machine, uses the Yggdrasil build script to
compile a binary, saves that to GITHUB_OUTPUT, starts a new machine (in this
case, Windows), downloads the compiled binary, and then patches the relevant
JLL package using Julia's [Override.toml mechanism](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/developers/custom_solver_binaries/).

## A workflow to test the cross-compiled binaries

To make things a bit simpler, I've changed it to use the relevant data for ECOS
instead of SCIP.

### Layout

This workflow assumes that you have a Julia package with the layout:

```
ECOS/
  .github/
    julia/
      build_tarballs.jl
    workflows/
      cross-compile-and-test.yml
  src/
    ECOS.jl
  test/
    runtests.jl
  Project.toml
```

### Julia script

Here is the contents for `.github/julia/build_tarballs.jl`:

```julia
using BinaryBuilder

name = "ECOS"
version = v"2.0.8"

# Collection of sources required to build ECOSBuilder
sources = [
    GitSource("https://github.com/embotech/ecos.git", "3b98fe0376ceeeb8310a06694b0a84ac59920f3f")
]

# Bash recipe for building across all platforms
script = raw"""
cd $WORKSPACE/srcdir/ecos*
make shared
mkdir -p ${libdir}
cp libecos.${dlext} ${libdir}
cp -r include ${prefix}
"""

# These are the platforms we will build for by default, unless further
# platforms are passed in on the command line
platforms = supported_platforms()

# The products that we will ensure are always built
products = [
    LibraryProduct("libecos", :libecos)
]

# Dependencies that must be installed before this package can be built
dependencies = Dependency[]

build_tarballs(
    ARGS,
    name,
    version,
    sources,
    script,
    platforms,
    products,
    dependencies,
    julia_compat = "1.6",
)
```

### YAML
