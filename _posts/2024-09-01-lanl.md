The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have signed an
agreement with [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov) to
develop an AI toolbox for JuMP.

The main deliverable is a new package, [MathOptAI.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/MathOptAI.jl),
which is a package for embedding trained machine learning predictors into a JuMP
model. MathOptAI is inspired by packages such as
[gurobi-machinelearning](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-machinelearning)
and [OMLT](https://github.com/cog-imperial/OMLT).

A second deliverable is to develop a toolbox for creating, deploying, managing,
and analyzing computational experiments related to JuMP on LANL's HPC clusters.
The goal of this task is to simplify experiments such as Carleton Coffrin's
[AC-OPF benchmark](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/ac-optimal-power-flow-in-various-nonlinear-optimization-frameworks/78486).

As a third deliverable, we will provide general support for LANL staff and their
project partners on JuMP and Julia for AI.

The agreement runs until September 2026, and the person being funded is
[Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a core contributor to JuMP, and
also a member of the Steering Committee.

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar, who is funded by the grant, and Carleton, who works at LANL, recused
themselves from Steering Committee votes on this agreement.)
