June 15-17, 2020, [Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium](https://goo.gl/maps/fyxqevrKn76nvhwq9).

This workshop is the fourth JuMP-dev workshop after the [first](/meetings/mit2017/),
[second](/meetings/bordeaux2018/), and [third](/meetings/santiago2019) JuMP-dev workshops.

The purpose of the workshop is to bring together students, researchers, and practitioners
with interests in the software aspects of [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) and
related packages. The workshop is open for anybody to attend. In particular, we invite new
contributors and those who have not met the core development team.

## Abstract Submission

**[Submit an abstract.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd7d3TJ2de0GSD56lEBrR8e6KmVlPANjwNsr09KroSAuIq-Xw/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Similarly to previous iterations of the workshop, we invite participants to
(optionally) present work related to JuMP. In particular, we especially seek
talks related to:

- JuMP core development ([MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl), JuMP 1.0)
- Mathematical optimization solvers written in Julia
- Automatic differentiation in Julia (e.g., Cassette, Zygote)
- Julia interfaces to solvers
- JuMP extensions (stochastic programming, robust optimization, multiobjective optimization, ...)
- Optimization libraries that use JuMP
- Developer tools for JuMP
- Commercial use of JuMP
- JuMP for teaching

Speakers are encouraged to highlight challenges and lessons learned, not only successes.
Talks should be aimed at a general audience, but familiarity with JuMP/Julia can be assumed.

See the [previous](/meetings/mit2017/) [JuMP-dev](/meetings/bordeaux2018/)
[workshops](/meetings/santiago2019) for examples of accepted talks.

Abstract submission will close **February 29**, and we expect to notify accepted speakers in
early March.

## Registration

A registration portal will be created shortly. Unlike previous years, there will be a
small registration fee.

## Plenary speaker

[Yurii Nesterov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurii_Nesterov) will give a plenary during the workshop, more details on the topic and schedule will be communicated shortly.
