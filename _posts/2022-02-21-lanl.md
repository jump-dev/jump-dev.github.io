title:  "NumFOCUS signs agreement with LANL to improve nonlinear support in JuMP"

The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have signed an
agreement with [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov) to
improve nonlinear support in JuMP.

The agreement runs until September 2023.

At a high-level, the agreement seeks to improve nonlinear support in JuMP on two
key fronts:
 * improving the automatic differentiation performance in JuMP by adding the
   ability to use different automatic differentiation backends
 * improving the modeling ergonomics of JuMP by adding the ability to create
   nonlinear expressions using the `@constraint` and `@objective` macros, and
   identifying ways to add vector-valued nonlinear functions.

In addition, there is scope to work on and improve other aspects of nonlinear
programming in JuMP.

We are well aware that JuMP 1.0 is nearing completion (https://github.com/jump-dev/JuMP.jl/issues/2564).
Therefore, no breaking changes will be merged in the near- to medium-term, and
we will endeavor to perform as much of the work as possible in a non-breaking
fashion. Any breaking changes will live in a separate branch and will guide our
decision making on when (and if) we release JuMP 2.0.

The first person being funded is [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a
core contributor to JuMP, and also a member of the Steering Committee.

Oscar will be working on a part-time basis of 10 hours per week.

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar, who is funded by the grant, and Carleton Coffrin, who is managing the
project for LANL, recused themselves from Steering Committee votes on this
agreement.)
