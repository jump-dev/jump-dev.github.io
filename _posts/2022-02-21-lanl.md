The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have signed an
agreement with [Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)](https://www.lanl.gov) to
improve nonlinear support in JuMP.

The agreement runs until September 2023.

At a high-level, the agreement seeks to improve nonlinear support in JuMP on two
key fronts:
 * improving the automatic differentiation performance in JuMP by adding the
   ability to use different automatic differentiation backends
 * improving the modeling ergonomics of JuMP by adding the ability to create
   nonlinear expressions using the `@constraint` and `@objective` macros, and
   identifying ways to add vector-valued nonlinear functions.

In addition, there is scope to work on and improve other aspects of nonlinear
programming in JuMP.

To discuss our plans or to get involved by suggesting improvements:
 * Read and comment on our work-in-progress Google doc
   ["Developing state-of-the-art nonlinear support in JuMP"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SfwFrIhLyzpRdXyHKMFKv_XKeyJ6mi6kvhnUZ2LEEjM/edit?usp=sharing)
 * Join the [monthly developer calls](https://jump.dev/pages/governance/#monthly-developer-call)
 * Join the [developer chatroom](https://jump.dev/pages/governance/#developer-chatroom)
   for updates and an invitation to semi-regular nonlinear developer calls.

The first person being funded is [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a
core contributor to JuMP, and also a member of the Steering Committee.

Oscar will be working on a part-time basis of 10 hours per week.

_Miles Lubin, Juan Pablo Vielma, and Changhyun Kwon_

(Per our [conflict of interest policy](/pages/governance/#conflict-of-interest),
Oscar, who is funded by the grant, and Carleton Coffrin, who is managing the
project for LANL, recused themselves from Steering Committee votes on this
agreement.)
