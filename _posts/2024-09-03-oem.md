The [JuMP Steering Committee](/pages/governance/#steering-committee) is pleased
to announce that we, through [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), have received a
large grant from the [Breakthrough Energy Foundation](https://www.breakthroughenergy.org)
to improve the performance of JuMP and [HiGHS](https://highs.dev) on open energy
models.

In our recent post, [Steering Committee changes](/announcements/2024/07/30/julian/),
we announced that Juan Pablo was stepping and Julian Hall (the lead developer of
HiGHS) was joining the committee: this grant was the reason!

## What this grant will be used for

Our main goal for this grant is to collate a suite of benchmark LP and MIP model
instances from JuMP-based open energy models such as
[GenX.jl](https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl),
[TulipaEnergyModel.jl](https://github.com/TulipaEnergy/TulipaEnergyModel.jl),
[Sienna](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna), and
[SpineOpt.jl](https://github.com/spine-tools/SpineOpt.jl), and then use the
benchmarks to guide improvements in JuMP and HiGHS.

Among other things, we will be parallelizing the HiGHS MIP solver and improving
the debugging experience of JuMP by adding generic IIS support.

## Project partners

[HiGHS](https://highs.dev) is world-leading open-source software for
mathematical optimization, created by Julian Hall and Ivet Galabova from solvers
written by University of Edinburgh PhD students. Development began in 2018, and
a MIP solver written by Leona Gottwald was added in 2022.

JuMP is an open-source domain-specific algebraic modelling language for
mathematical optimization embedded in Julia. JuMP development began in 2013.
JuMP was recognized by the [2015 COIN-OR Cup](https://www.coin-or.org/coinCup/coinCup2015Winner.html),
the [2016 INFORMS Computing Society Prize](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/INFORMS-Computing-Society/INFORMS-Computing-Society-Prize),
and the [2021 Beale–Orchard-Hays Prize](https://www.mathopt.org/?nav=boh).

The agreement runs for one year, and the people being funded are:

* [Dr. Julian Hall](https://github.com/jajhall), the lead developer of the
  HiGHS solver
* [Dr. Ivet Galabova](https://github.com/galabova), the HiGHS Integration and
  Development manager
* [Dr. Joaquim Dias Garcia](https://github.com/joaquimg), a core contributor to
  JuMP
* [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow), a core contributor to JuMP, and
  also a member of the Steering Committee.

## Next steps

If you are an open energy modeller who uses JuMP or HiGHS and you want to stay
in touch with our progress or provide us with feedback and examples, write to
`jump-highs-energy-models@googlegroups.com`. We'd love to hear how you are using
JuMP or HiGHS to solve problems related to open energy modelling.

The first part of our work will focus on creating the benchmark examples in the
[jump-dev/open-energy-modeling-benchmarks](https://github.com/jump-dev/open-energy-modeling-benchmarks)
repository. Please open an issue if you have ideas or suggestions.

We will also be posting monthly updates to this blog under the
[#open-energy-modeling](/categories/#open-energy-modeling) tag.
