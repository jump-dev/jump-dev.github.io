## What is JuMP?

JuMP is a modeling language and collection of supporting packages for
mathematical optimization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

JuMP makes it easy to formulate and solve a range of problem classes, including
linear programs, integer programs, conic programs, semidefinite programs, and
constrained nonlinear programs. Here's an example:

```julia
julia> using JuMP, Ipopt

julia> function solve_constrained_least_squares_regression(A::Matrix, b::Vector)
           m, n = size(A)
           model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)
           set_silent(model)
           @variable(model, x[1:n])
           @variable(model, residuals[1:m])
           @constraint(model, residuals == A * x - b)
           @constraint(model, sum(x) == 1)
           @objective(model, Min, sum(residuals.^2))
           optimize!(model)
           return value.(x)
       end
solve_constrained_least_squares_regression (generic function with 1 method)

julia> A, b = rand(10, 3), rand(10);

julia> x = solve_constrained_least_squares_regression(A, b)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.4137624719002825
 0.09707679853084578
 0.48916072956887174
```
