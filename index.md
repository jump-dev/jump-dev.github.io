## What is JuMP?

JuMP is a modeling language and collection of supporting packages for
mathematical optimization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

JuMP makes it easy to formulate and solve a range of problem classes, including
linear programs, integer programs, conic programs, semidefinite programs, and
constrained nonlinear programs.

You can use it to

even [optimize milk output](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/moo/).

## Resources for getting started

 * Decide if you should use JuMP by reading [Should I use JuMP?](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/background/should_i_use/)
 * Install JuMP and Julia by reading the [Installation Guide](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/)
 * Learn Julia by reading [Getting started with Julia](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/Getting%20started/an_introduction_to_julia/)
 * Solve your first JuMP model by reading [Getting started with JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/Getting%20started/getting_started_with_JuMP/)
 * Get help by joining the [community forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt/13)
  to search for answers to commonly asked questions.

There is a growing collection of third-party materials about JuMP. This includes
the book,
[Julia Programming for Operations Research](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/),
which covers a variety of topics on optimization, with an emphasis on solving
practical problems using JuMP and Julia.

The JuMP ecosystem includes [Convex.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl),
an algebraic modeling language for convex optimization based on the concept of
[Disciplined Convex Programming](https://dcp.stanford.edu/).

Outside of the JuMP organization:
- [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers) provides a
  collection of tools primarily designed for developing solvers for smooth
  nonlinear optimization.
- [JuliaNLSolvers](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers) offers implementations in
  Julia of standard standard optimization algorithms for unconstrained or
  box-constrained problems such as BFGS, Nelder-Mead, conjugate gradient, etc.

JuMP is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the
United States. NumFOCUS provides JuMP with fiscal, legal, and administrative
support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit
[numfocus.org](https://numfocus.org) for more information.

You can support JuMP by [donating](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-jump/index.html).

Donations to JuMP are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States,
your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. As with any donation,
you should consult with your tax adviser about your particular tax situation.

JuMP's largest expense is the annual JuMP-dev workshop. Donations will help us
provide travel support for JuMP-dev attendees and take advantage of other
opportunities that arise to support JuMP development.
