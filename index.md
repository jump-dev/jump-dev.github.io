## What is JuMP?

JuMP is a modeling language and collection of supporting packages for
mathematical optimization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

JuMP makes it easy to formulate and solve a range of problem classes, including
linear programs, integer programs, conic programs, semidefinite programs, and
constrained nonlinear programs.

even [optimize milk output](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/moo/).

## Resources for getting started

 * Decide if you should use JuMP by reading [Should I use JuMP?](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/should_i_use/)
 * Install JuMP and Julia by reading the [Installation Guide](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/)
 * Learn Julia by reading [Getting started with Julia](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started_with_julia/)
 * Solve your first JuMP model by reading [Getting started with JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started_with_JuMP/)
 * Get help by joining the [community forum](/forum)
  to search for answers to commonly asked questions.

There is a growing collection of third-party materials about JuMP. This includes
the book,
[Julia Programming for Operations Research](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/),
which covers a variety of topics on optimization, with an emphasis on solving
practical problems using JuMP and Julia.

## Get involved

JuMP is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the
United States. NumFOCUS provides JuMP with fiscal, legal, and administrative
support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit
[numfocus.org](https://numfocus.org) for more information.

You can support JuMP by [donating](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-jump/index.html).

Donations to JuMP are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States,
your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. As with any donation,
you should consult with your tax adviser about your particular tax situation.

JuMP's largest expense is the annual JuMP-dev workshop. Donations will help us
provide travel support for JuMP-dev attendees and take advantage of other
opportunities that arise to support JuMP development.
