**Welcome to the new website for JuMP. This site remains under construction as we transition from [juliaopt.org](http://juliaopt.org).**

JuMP is a modeling language and supporting packages for mathematical
optimization in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

JuMP makes it easy to formulate
and solve linear programming, semidefinite programming, integer programming,
convex optimization, constrained nonlinear optimization, and related classes
of optimization problems. You can use it to

## Getting started

To get started, read the
[Installation Guide](https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/)
in the JuMP documentation. Once you've installed JuMP, a good next step is the
[Quickstart Guide](https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/stable/quickstart/).
There are also a number of tutorials available at
[JuMPTutorials.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMPTutorials.jl).
For materials on learning Julia, see [here](https://julialang.org/learning/).

If you need help, search the [Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/opt)
for similar questions, or open a new one.

There is a growing collection of third-party materials about JuMP. This includes
the book,
[Julia Programming for Operations Research](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/),
which covers a variety of topics on optimization, with an emphasis on solving
practical problems using JuMP and Julia.

## See also

The JuMP ecosystem includes [Convex.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/Convex.jl),
an algebraic modeling language for convex optimization based on the concept of
[Disciplined Convex Programming](https://dcp.stanford.edu/). Outside of the
JuMP organization:

- [JuliaSmoothOptimizers](https://github.com/JuliaSmoothOptimizers) provides a
  collection of tools primarily designed for developing solvers for smooth
  nonlinear optimization.

- [JuliaNLSolvers](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers) offers implementations in
  Julia of standard standard optimization algorithms for unconstrained or
  box-constrained problems such as BFGS, Nelder-Mead, conjugate gradient, etc.

- JuliaHub lists 70+
  [optimization packages in Julia](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages?t=optimization)!

## NumFOCUS

JuMP is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the
United States. NumFOCUS provides JuMP with fiscal, legal, and administrative
support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit
[numfocus.org](https://numfocus.org) for more information.

You can support JuMP by [donating](https://numfocus.salsalabs.org/donate-to-jump/index.html).

Donations to JuMP are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States,
your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. As with any donation,
you should consult with your tax adviser about your particular tax situation.

JuMP's largest expense is the annual JuMP-dev workshop. Donations will help us
provide travel support for JuMP-dev attendees and take advantage of other
opportunities that arise to support JuMP development.
